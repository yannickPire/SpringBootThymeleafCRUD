# SpringBootThymeleafCRUD

This project is about a small CRUD appliction which is created in Spring Boot with a Thymeleaf Front End. 
I also implemented Spring AOP for logging and Form Validations in Java, through Validation Annotations and Thymeleaf.

This is a really simple project to get myself familiar with this matter. Any other input to extend this project is much appreciated

Cheers
